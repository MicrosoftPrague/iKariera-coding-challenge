## Resolving challenges

Please take note that you **must** be a student at Czech Technical University in Prague in order to be eligible for the prize at stake. If selected for the barbeque on the terrace :fork_and_knife:, you will have to present your valid student ID issued by the university. The challenges are free to be resolved by anyone.

The hard deadline for this challenge is **21.04.2019 23:55 CET**.

We will announce the winners by **28.04.2019 23:55 CET** via email.

After you finish the challenges, please make sure to email us at [joinprg@microsoft.com](mailto:joinprg@microsoft.com) with details on how to access your repository (you will add one of the judges as [collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)). Please include - `[iKariera]` - in the subject line when sending this email :bow:

### Prerequisites

* [.NET Core 2.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio 2017+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* an appetite for coding

An minimal knowledge of C# is required in order to resolve those challenges. For a complete list of tutorial please refer to the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/). If you wish to resolve those challenges in a different programming language please email [joinprg@microsoft.com](mailto:joinprg@microsoft.com).

### Project structure

The solution contains 3 projects:
* **CodingChallenges** which contains static classes with an entry point
* **CodingChallenges.Tests** which contains test classes with different assertions
* **CodingChallenges.Worker** which is a console application meant to help you in debugging

### How to get started
[Create a new **private** repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-new-repository) and start resolving the challenges. GitHub offers [unlimited private repositories](https://github.com/pricing) for individual accounts. Making your repository private is *critical* if you don't want others getting inspired by your solutions.
