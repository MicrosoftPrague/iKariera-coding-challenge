# iKariera Coding Challenge

This repo contains code challenges for the iKari√©ra Jobfair hosted at Czech technical university in Prague between *09.04.2019 - 10.04.02019* at *09:00-16:00*

## Resolving challenges

You probably already know the prize at stake from our colleagues at the booth - a chance to engage with Microsoft employees during a barbeque on the terrace :fork_and_knife: for the first 20 people to resolve as many challenges as possible.

### Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.NET Core 2.1+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* an appetite for coding

An minimal knowledge of C# is required in order to resolve those challenges. For a complete list of tutorial please refer to the [Microsoft docc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/). If you wish to resolve those challenges in a different language please email [laurentiu.stamate@microsoft.com](laurentiu.stamate@microsoft.com).

### Project structure

The solution contains 3 projects:
* **CodingChallenges** which contains static classes with an entry point
* **CodingChallenges.Tests** which contains a test class with different assertions
* **CodingChallenges.Worker** which is a console application meant to help you in debugging

### How to get started
[Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) and start resolving the challenges.

### Challenge example
```csharp
/****
**  Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
**  For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
**  For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
**  For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
****/

namespace CodingChallenges
{
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;

    public static class FizzBuzz
    {
        public static void PrintNumbers()
        {
            // TODO Add implementation
        }
    }
}
```
